# Basement.sav
Notes made during the making of an all-in-one PC gaming hub from the games in my basement.

This was achieved by dumping all my personal ROM's and save files on every console my Dad and I collected over the years. And then configuring all the files to run via the use of emulators running on a single PC (Windows). I found [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/download) to be the best soloution for multiple emulators as an all-in-one frontend.

 - I use PS4 dual shock controller with this [script](https://github.com/Shellywell123/BigBox_PS4_home_button_Launcher) to launch LaunchBox in BigBox mode and have configured the same controller to each emulator.
 - I set all emulators to launch the selected ROM directly in full screen mode for Sega Saturn I used this [script](https://github.com/Shellywell123/Launch-Box_Yaba_Sanshiro_Fullscreen_AutoHotKey_Script)

# Recovering save game files
To transfer a game's progress from the orginal hardware to emulation, the save files need to be dumped. 

Different consoles use different formats and methods of storing these files. Typically a cartridge based console will store the save data on the cartridge its self (alongside the game ROM). Disc based consoles store the save data in a seperate location to the games files. (older consoles have dedicated memory cards).

N.B. I found all RetroArch cores to convert save file formats into `.srm`. I.e they need to be converted back to their orginal format if you want to use them with orginal hardware/non RetroArch emulators.

Below I have began detailing notes for different console emulators and save file recovery methods
